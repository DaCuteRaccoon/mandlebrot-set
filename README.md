# [Mandlebrot Set](https://dacuteraccoon.github.io/mandlebrot-set/)
Later on, I will try to make a Mandlebrot set that zooms in - how cool is that?
## About the Mandlebrot Set
- The Mandlebrot set is an example of a [fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal)
- It's named after [Beno√Æt Mandelbrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoit_Mandelbrot)
- It can be explained with the equation **z<sub>n+1</sub>=z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup>+c**

I can't explain all this stuff to you, there is ***so much more to learn about the Mandlebrot set***. Visit the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) for more detailed information.
